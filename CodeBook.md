Features in tidy.RData 
======================

The data set "tidy.RData" is the result of collecting, working with and cleaning
an existing data set. It is an R "data.frame" that contains 180 obs. of  86
variables (excluding Subject numbers and Activity labels). The variables in this
data set, are calculated  mean values per Subsject (experiment volunteers) and
Activity, that derive from mean and standard deviation values of features
measured from an accelerometer and gyroscope as presented in an experimental
data set (UCI HAR Dataset).

Specifically, the source values are mean and standard deviation values
(as calculated using the functions `mean()`, `std()`) of the following features:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

For details about the original features' data set (description and raw 3-axial
signals), look at the respective metadata file (UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt
and REAMDE.txt).

The complete list of calculated mean values for the variables in question, is
available in 'features.tidy.RData'
